Car Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately predict the selling price of used cars.
The model was developed using a dataset compiled from two different sources. The core process involved:
•	Cleaning and preparing the data: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency across all features.
•	Creating new features: Engineering features like car age and kilometers driven per year to improve model accuracy.
•	Training and tuning a model: We used a Gradient Boosting Regressor and optimized it with GridSearchCV to achieve the best possible performance.
The final model achieved a strong R-squared score of 0.878 on the test data, providing reliable price predictions.
